# LifeOS Philosophy

> **The 10 Commandments of Cognitive Sovereignty**

---

## Preamble

These principles are not suggestions. They are the **constitutional law** of any system that claims to be LifeOS-compatible.

Violate them, and you're building something else — perhaps useful, but not LifeOS.

---

## The 10 Commandments

### I. Presence Before Action

> **"No action without stable human presence."**

The system must verify cognitive stability before executing any action. An overwhelmed, distracted, or impaired human cannot give valid consent.

**Implementation**: Presence Loop with state detection.

---

### II. Memory With Intention

> **"Remember with purpose, not by accumulation."**

Memory is not logging. The system forgets by design. What remains must be intentional, versioned, and explainable.

**Implementation**: MemoryOS with TTL, consent, and governance.

---

### III. Double Lock Always

> **"AI proposes. Human decides. Twice."**

First lock: The human classifies what the thought IS.  
Second lock: The human authorizes the ACTION.

No shortcuts. No "smart defaults" that skip consent.

**Implementation**: CognitiveFlow with ExecutionGate.

---

### IV. No Hidden Agents

> **"Every agent is visible, bounded, and revocable."**

The human must know what agents exist, what they can access, and must be able to terminate them instantly.

**Implementation**: Agent manifest + kill switch.

---

### V. Data Stays With Owner

> **"Your data lives in your pod."**

Applications come to the data, not the reverse. Changing providers must not mean losing memories.

**Implementation**: Solid-compatible pods.

---

### VI. No Central Master

> **"Federated, not centralized."**

No single entity controls the network. Regional clusters operate independently and communicate via open protocols.

**Implementation**: P2P federation protocol.

---

### VII. Traceable Decisions

> **"Every decision has a visible path."**

When the system makes a recommendation, the human can see WHY — which memories activated, which signals triggered it.

**Implementation**: Explainability layer in SenseMaking.

---

### VIII. Consent Is Sacred

> **"Explicit > Implicit > Denied"**

Consent must be recorded, versioned, and revocable. "I didn't know" is a system failure, not a user error.

**Implementation**: Consent registry with audit trail.

---

### IX. Regional Sovereignty

> **"Data near the user, financed by the user."**

Each region can operate its own infrastructure. No dependency on foreign entities for essential cognitive services.

**Implementation**: Water Model financing.

---

### X. Open Specification

> **"Anyone can implement LifeOS."**

The specification is open. Implementations can be proprietary, but the standard belongs to everyone.

**Implementation**: This repository.

## Interpretation Guide

When facing an ambiguous design decision, ask:

1. **Does this increase or decrease human agency?**
2. **Does this make the system more or less explainable?**
3. **Does this centralize or distribute power?**

Always choose the option that increases agency, explainability, and distribution.

## Amendments

These commandments can be amended through:

1. Public discussion (GitHub issues)
2. Proposal with rationale
3. Rough consensus among contributors
4. Update with changelog

No commandment can be amended to reduce human sovereignty.
